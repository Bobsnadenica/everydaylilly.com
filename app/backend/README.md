# Everyday Lilly vault backend

## Personal albums and iPhone photos — 2026-09-20

- `grandma` grants family viewing and attributed photo uploads, not administrator privileges. Test claims retain priority and cannot upload into the family collection. Add only the owner-approved account; fresh sign-in is required for changed group claims.
- Regular uploads now use `months/<0-59>/by/<sha256(subject)[0:32]>/<filename>`. The API ignores client-supplied ownership. Hero uploads remain admin-only at the existing path; conditional PUT still prevents replacement.
- The default manifest shares media across authorized family members and computes `isMine` for the requesting identity. `?scope=mine` filters before signing and provides a live personal manifest; it does not depend on a stale saved list. CloudFront's API origin request policy forwards `scope` as well as `refresh`. No extra API route is needed.
- HEIC/HEIF originals remain intact. The worker's pinned Pillow/Pillow-Heif dependencies decode them into private metadata-free `<digest>.display.jpg` full-resolution views and existing `<digest>.jpg` 640px previews. The manifest withholds HEIC without a display derivative and returns `pendingCount`. Existing JPEG/video preview processing remains unchanged. All derivatives stay under the already-authorized `previews/months/` prefix, so no broader worker IAM permissions are required.
- Deployment used source-verified copies of the live Lambda packages, preserving signing keys and environment configuration. Only Lambda code, API query forwarding and the new Cognito group were changed. No full Terraform apply was performed. Import the group into recovered authoritative state and reconcile these edits before a future apply.
- Build the worker with `python3 scripts/build-gallery-thumbnails.py /private/tmp/gallery-thumbnails.zip`; the builder verifies pinned Linux x86_64 Python 3.12 wheel hashes. Worker tests need `pip install -r tests/requirements-thumbnail.txt` in an isolated environment, followed by `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'`. Frontend/backend tests: `node --test tests/*.test.cjs`.
- Browser QA used synthetic photos. Live Lambda invocations exercised personal/family manifests with controlled authorizer claims, and real signed CloudFront reads verified JPEG delivery. This does not certify a Hosted UI login as the grandmother. No password was changed.



Initial review: **2026-09-10**. Stored-preview deployment and live verification: **2026-09-11 (Europe/Sofia)**.

The vault is a deployed, Terraform-managed AWS serverless backend in **eu-central-1 (Frankfurt)**. The public site is hosted on GitHub Pages and calls Cognito directly. No Amplify integration is used by this repository.

## Private month dates — 2026-09-11

The monthly manifest now includes `timelineStartDate`, sourced from the Lambda environment variable `GALLERY_TIMELINE_START_DATE`. It is returned only after the existing JWT/role checks; the test collection receives null. The actual value stays out of public HTML, JavaScript, documentation and Git. Terraform exposes the sensitive input `gallery_timeline_start_date`; restore its live value into controlled production variables before any future plan/apply. The default is empty for an unconfigured deployment.

The frontend calculates monthly anniversaries in UTC, clamps short-month boundaries, and displays an inclusive Bulgarian date range in the upload heading. This change was deployed by preserving the existing Lambda package/signing files and other environment variables; no full Terraform apply. Normal authenticated API checks verified the date configuration and retained all original/preview pairs.

## Stored preview deployment — 2026-09-11

`lambda/gallery_thumbnails/handler.py` runs as `everyday-lilly-vault-prod-gallery-thumbnails` (Python 3.12, x86_64, 1024 MB, 150-second timeout). S3 object-created events under `months/` generate JPEG previews with FFmpeg. Preview keys are `previews/months/<sha256(original-key + newline + unquoted-etag)>.jpg`, outside the event prefix to prevent recursion. Outputs contain no copied metadata, fit within 640 × 640 pixels, and use conditional PUT plus immutable caching. Source objects are only read.

`gallery_thumbnails.tf` records the worker, its IAM role/policy/log attachment, S3 invoke permission, bucket notification and 14-day log retention. IAM permits reading monthly originals and writing only the preview prefix. Generation is idempotent. No reserved concurrency is configured; the controlled backfill used two concurrent invocations.

The manifest lists original and preview prefixes separately, signs the matching previews as `thumbnailUrl`, and keeps derived files out of album counts. CloudFront's existing trusted key group and private S3 origin protect previews. The browser uses small images in the grid/carousel and loads originals in the viewer. The test collection is outside the thumbnail event prefix. Stable signed URLs and content-based preview keys support caching; refresh does not force a new media version. The existing long-lived signed-URL caveat remains.

Signing twice as many URLs exposed the old 10-second API Lambda limit. The signer now parses the private key once per warm runtime; the API Lambda uses 1024 MB for more signing CPU and a 15-second timeout. JWT and role checks still run for each manifest request.

Build the worker package from the repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/build-gallery-thumbnails.py app/backend/live/prod/lambda/gallery_thumbnails/package.zip
```

The builder downloads the pinned imageio-ffmpeg 0.6.0 Linux wheel from PyPI, verifies its SHA-256, and packages the executable, licenses and handler. The ZIP is ignored by Git. No family media or credentials belong in a package.

This was an **isolated AWS deployment, with no Terraform plan/apply**. The API package was downloaded from the existing Lambda and its code SHA verified; only `index.mjs` was replaced, preserving the deployed signing-key files. Authoritative Terraform state, variables and standalone PEM files remain absent locally. Before a future full apply, recover them as described below, then import/reconcile these already-existing resources:

| Terraform address | Existing resource |
| --- | --- |
| `aws_iam_role.gallery_thumbnails` | `everyday-lilly-vault-prod-gallery-thumbnails-lambda` |
| `aws_iam_role_policy.gallery_thumbnails` | Role above, inline policy `gallery-previews` |
| `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.gallery_thumbnails_logs` | Role above, `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` |
| `aws_lambda_function.gallery_thumbnails` | `everyday-lilly-vault-prod-gallery-thumbnails` |
| `aws_lambda_permission.gallery_thumbnails_s3` | Function above, statement `AllowGalleryThumbnailEvents` |
| `aws_s3_bucket_notification.gallery_thumbnails` | Existing gallery bucket notification configuration |
| `aws_cloudwatch_log_group.gallery_thumbnails` | `/aws/lambda/everyday-lilly-vault-prod-gallery-thumbnails` |

The bucket had no notification before deployment. Preserve any later notifications when reconciling this bucket-wide Terraform resource. Review the recovered plan for replacements/deletions; do not apply against empty state.

Verification: all 455 originals retained their keys, sizes and ETags; all 455 expected previews exist (about 14.7 MB). All eight video posters returned signed JPEG responses, and an unsigned preview returned 403. Normal Cognito authentication returned the admin monthly manifest with all original/preview pairs in 2.88 seconds after the capacity change. Both Lambdas are Active; worker log retention is 14 days. Existing-media generation was exercised through controlled invocations; the S3 notification configuration was verified without adding synthetic media to the production album.

## Frontend follow-up — 2026-09-10 (historical)

The owner assigned the reviewed account to `admin`; a read-only AWS check confirmed that membership. The gallery now opens a selected month, offers a staged multi-file upload batch, and no longer requires an initial hero upload. It continues to use the existing manifest and upload-url endpoints and zero-based month keys. Existing hero files remain viewable; no media was moved.

The frontend no longer persists signed manifests. It validates authorization on every page load, reuses the in-memory result for month navigation, refreshes the session before API calls, and clears legacy caches on auth changes. Refresh/upload completion refetches metadata without a `refresh` cache-busting parameter, retaining stable photo URLs. Images are lazy-loaded. The browser-decoded video preview approach was subsequently replaced by stored JPEG previews, as documented above. This fixes the frontend cache/account and expired-startup-token findings described in the historical review below. The Lambda's one-year signing-window minimum and browser immutable media caching remain unchanged.

These are static-site changes, not a backend deployment. No Terraform apply or new AWS service is needed. Eight dependency-free regression tests and loopback browser fixture checks passed; the owner authorized publishing this release through GitHub Pages from main. Production upload writes were not exercised during this update.

Terraform requires version >= 1.9.0 and the AWS (~> 6.0), archive (~> 2.5), and random (~> 3.6) providers. The API Lambda runs Node.js 22; its current capacity is 1024 MB with a 15-second timeout. At review time it was Active, last update Successful, with a last-modified timestamp of 2026-06-16.

## Login and authorization

Hosted UI base: `https://everyday-lilly-vault-prod-1234.auth.eu-central-1.amazoncognito.com`.

Start normal login from the website's Sign In button so `auth/auth.js` creates the matching OAuth state and PKCE verifier. Opening a bare Hosted UI login URL without this pending state is not a complete website login test.

Verified app-client configuration:

- OAuth flow: authorization code.
- Scopes: `openid`, `email`, `profile`, `aws.cognito.signin.user.admin`.
- Callbacks: `https://www.everydaylilly.com/auth/callback.html` and `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback.html`.
- Logout URLs: `https://www.everydaylilly.com/` and `http://localhost:8000/`.
- Explicit auth flows: refresh token, user auth, password auth, and SRP auth.
- Username-existence suppression: enabled.

The frontend exchanges the code at Cognito's token endpoint and stores the session in session storage, or local storage for remembered sessions. Its helper supports refresh tokens. Terraform configures 60-minute ID/access tokens and 30-day refresh tokens.

The API accepts a Cognito ID token in `Authorization: Bearer …`. API Gateway verifies the issuer/audience; Lambda checks `token_use == id` and role claims. There is no standalone database for gallery permissions.

| Role/claim | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `admin` or `admins` group | Monthly gallery and upload capability |
| `viewers` or `viewer` group | Monthly gallery, read only |
| `grandma` group | Personal/family gallery, own photo uploads |
| `test` group or supported test claim | Test collection; takes precedence over monthly routing |
| No permitted role/claim | Manifest returns 403 |

Supported test claims are `custom:tag`, `custom:tags`, `tag`, `tags`, `custom:test`, and `test`. Upload authorization independently requires an admin or grandma group and rejects test accounts; grandma is limited to ordinary photos. Terraform defines `admin`, `viewers` and `grandma`; the live pool also contains `test`, whose creation is not represented in the current Terraform files.

**2026-09-10 account review:** the owner-supplied account was enabled and confirmed but had no group memberships. The browser showed “This account is not assigned to a gallery role.” An intentionally assigned gallery role and fresh tokens are required; an admin-looking email does not confer access. No memberships were changed during review.

For investigation, use `admin-get-user` with a query limited to Enabled/UserStatus and `admin-list-groups-for-user`. Keep account identifiers and returned attributes out of repository notes. An `invalid_scope` error requires comparing the requested scopes to the live app client; do not blindly apply Terraform as a repair. Scopes matched during this review.

## API and storage flow

CloudFront endpoints:

- `GET https://d1fxhro74spn7q.cloudfront.net/api/gallery/manifest`
- `POST https://d1fxhro74spn7q.cloudfront.net/api/gallery/upload-url`

CloudFront forwards `/api/*` to `ebz7pirts5.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com` with caching disabled. Both routes use JWT authorization. The Lambda lists the authorized S3 prefix with pagination and returns metadata plus signed media URLs. The default CloudFront media behavior requires a trusted key group and reaches S3 through Origin Access Control.

Both archive and gallery buckets have all S3 public-access-block settings enabled. The archive's enabled lifecycle rule transitions eligible objects to `DEEP_ARCHIVE` after seven days; S3 lifecycle size eligibility still applies. Archive objects are not served by the gallery Lambda.

New gallery keys use zero-based month IDs:

```text
months/<0-59>/<filename>          Legacy normal media
months/<0-59>/by/<owner>/<file>   New attributed media
months/hero/<0-59>/<filename>     Month cover images
test/<filename>                  Test collection
```

The UI labels those month IDs 1–60, grouped into five years. Flat legacy numeric media paths remain supported by the frontend; consult its parser before renaming existing objects. The paths above are examples, not a listing of private files.

Admin upload sequence:

1. Open a month and select/drop one or more files into its upload panel; review and confirm the destination. No hero upload is required.
2. Request an upload URL with month ID, filename, content type, and upload kind.
3. Lambda checks upload privileges and the authenticated contributor, validates the request, and rejects an existing target with 409.
4. The browser PUTs directly to S3 using a URL valid for at most 900 seconds and the returned signed headers, including `If-None-Match: *`.
5. Conditional PUT prevents overwrite races. The batch refreshes the manifest, and an S3 event creates a preview. Bounded follow-up refreshes can pick up the preview; manual refresh remains available.

The current review did not upload or modify production media.

## Cache and session findings from the initial review

- The browser stores manifests in `localStorage` for one hour under a collection-only key. It can reuse them without an API request, and logout does not clear them. This allows account changes in one browser to reuse a previous account's signed URLs and capability UI. Bind caches to the authenticated user and clear/revalidate them on logout or account changes. Backend upload checks remain in force.
- The signer clamps its expiry window to **at least 31,536,000 seconds** and rounds expiry to the next boundary. A URL's remaining validity ranges up to that window, rather than always being one full year from issuance. CloudFront/browser media caching is long-lived and immutable. Logout or removing a group does not revoke previously issued URLs or recall downloaded/browser-cached media.
- `gallery_cache_version` and the UI's refresh parameter change URL/cache versions; they are not access revocation controls. Lowering the Terraform TTL alone does not remove the Lambda's one-year minimum.
- The gallery captures a session once during startup and reuses that token for later refreshes and uploads. Reacquire a refreshed session for each API action to avoid failures after token expiry.

These describe the pre-update source. At the initial review, deployed auth/gallery scripts matched local files byte for byte; the subsequent frontend fixes above are included in this release. Cross-account cache reproduction, long-running token expiry, and issued-media revocation were not exercised against real accounts/media.

## WAF status

Earlier documentation described CAPTCHA and WAF rate blocking that are not present in the current configuration. Current Terraform has no WAF resources and the live `eu-central-1` regional web ACL listing was empty. Cognito username-existence suppression is enabled; MFA is off and user-pool deletion protection is inactive in the inspected live pool. Do not describe a deployed custom WAF/CAPTCHA layer based on the older notes.

## Production state and deployment prerequisites

There is no remote backend block in the Terraform source. The documented workflow relies on externally retained/local state, but the authoritative production state location was **not established** during this review.

The following are **absent in this checkout**:

- `live/prod/terraform.tfstate`
- `live/prod/terraform.tfvars`
- `live/prod/.terraform/`
- `live/prod/lambda/gallery_manifest/gallery_private_key.pem`
- `live/prod/lambda/gallery_manifest/gallery_public_key.pem`

`gallery_api.tf` reads the public PEM and packages the Lambda directory; `index.mjs` loads the private PEM at runtime. These files are ignored by Git. A fresh clone therefore does not contain enough material to reproduce the deployed Lambda package.

Before a full Terraform plan/apply:

1. Recover the authoritative state and production variables from their controlled storage and verify they describe the existing resources above. Do not assume an empty local state represents the deployed environment.
2. Restore the existing matching signing key files through the controlled secret-handling process. Never print or commit the private key. Rotation is a separate operational change affecting signed media access.
3. Initialize Terraform against the verified state setup, validate, and review a plan for unexpected replacement or destruction before applying an authorized change. Keep state and plans access-controlled.

Do not copy `terraform.tfvars.example` over recovered production values. Its domain and CloudFront values are placeholders. The public GitHub Pages frontend has a separate publication path; Terraform does not publish those static pages. No repository GitHub Actions deployment workflow was present during review.

Safe source checks from the repository root:

```bash
node --check app/backend/live/prod/lambda/gallery_manifest/index.mjs
terraform fmt -check app/backend/live/prod
git diff --check
```

The JavaScript syntax and Terraform formatting checks passed on 2026-09-10. Full Terraform validation/plan/apply was not performed because the deployment inputs were unavailable. No AWS changes were made.

## Live smoke results and limits

- Unauthenticated manifest GET: 401. Use GET; an unsupported HEAD request returns 404 and does not test this route's authorization.
- Unsigned CloudFront media request: 403.
- Direct S3 media request: 403.
- Signed-out gallery URL: redirects to the public homepage.
- Browser gallery attempt: role-denied message; reviewed account has no groups.
- Live Lambda: Active/Successful. API routes: JWT protected. CloudFront distribution: enabled and Deployed.

Private-media rendering, successful upload, full credential entry, password reset, and viewer/test-account isolation were not verified end to end. Do not treat the review as a complete release certification.

## Destructive teardown

The root `cleanup.sh` runs `terraform destroy` and then removes local state, plans, and `.terraform/`. Its `--yes` option skips its confirmation and enables Terraform auto-approval. It is a teardown tool, not routine cleanup or auth troubleshooting. Do not run it to recover a missing local state or fix a login failure.
