  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Everyday Lilly</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) respects your privacy and handles information you provide or generate while using the app.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection</h2>
  <p>
    Everyday Lilly <strong>does not collect, use, store, or sell any personal information</strong> by default. All data created and used in the app is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to us or any third party unless you explicitly choose to share or back it up.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage & Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    Your data remains on your device and is accessible offline. The app does not require internet access to function. However, certain optional features such as sharing content, backing up data to cloud services, or unlocking achievements may require permissions or interaction with third-party services or APIs. These actions are only performed with your explicit consent and involve only the data you choose to share.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The app itself does not use third-party services that collect information to identify you. Any third-party services used for optional features operate under their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review those policies before enabling such features.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Everyday Lilly does not knowingly collect or solicit any personal information from children under 13 years of age. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
  </p>

  <h2>User Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Since we do not collect or store your personal data, you retain full control over your information. You have the right to access, correct, or delete any data stored on your device related to the app. If you use optional features that involve third-party services, your rights regarding that data will be governed by those third parties' policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We prioritize the security of your data stored on your device. The app does not transmit your data over the internet unless you explicitly choose to share or back it up. We recommend keeping your device secure and using device-level protections such as passcodes or biometric locks to safeguard your information.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted on this page with the date of revision.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
